# Image-Segmentation-using-K_means, U-Net ,SegNet
Image segmentation is a computer vision task that involves dividing an image into meaningful regions or segments. Unlike image classification, which assigns a single label to the entire image, segmentation classifies each pixel individually, providing detailed information about object shapes, boundaries, and locations.

1. K_Means:
k-Means is a simple clustering algorithm used to segment an image based on pixel similarity. It groups pixels into k clusters depending on their features (like color, intensity, or texture).

2. U-Net:
U-Net is a deep learning architecture designed for image segmentation, especially in medical imaging. It performs pixel-level classification, meaning it assigns a label to every pixel in an image to identify regions of interest (e.g., tumors, organs, lesions).

3. SegNet:
SegNet is a deep learning architecture for semantic image segmentation. It classifies each pixel in an image, assigning it to a specific class, but differs from U-Net in how it reconstructs the segmented image.
